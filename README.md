# GoCore — Pay-per-use Transportable Microreactor (Conceptual)

Customer-facing website + booking dashboard for GoCore trucks. Trucks are **never sold** — revenue = metered energy units + transport charges (+ crew standby).

> **Disclosure:** GoCore is a conceptual project. No functioning nuclear reactor exists; the first prototype is a non-nuclear tabletop demonstration. All figures on the site are illustrative.

## Stack
React 19 · Vite 7 · Tailwind CSS 4 · TypeScript. Output is a single self-contained `dist/index.html` (via `vite-plugin-singlefile`) plus `dist/images/*`.
Routing is hash-based (`#/dashboard`), so **no server rewrite rules are needed** on any host.

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # outputs ./dist
npm run preview    # serve the production build locally
```

## Start in production with Node (`npm start` / `yarn start`)
For platforms that run a generic `start` command (Replit-style runners, Render, Railway, Heroku, a VPS with pm2…):
```bash
npm install
npm start          # or: yarn start / node server.js
```
`server.js` is a zero-dependency Node server that serves `./dist` on `$PORT` (default `3000`, host `0.0.0.0`), exposes `/healthz`, and **runs `npm run build` automatically if `dist/` is missing**.
- Needs **Node 20.19+ or 22+** (required by Vite 7). Install dev dependencies too (plain `npm install`, not `--omit=dev`) so the auto-build works — or run `npm run build` in your build step.
- `npm start` works because npm/Yarn fall back to `node server.js` when no `start` script exists. If your platform insists on an explicit script, add this one line to `scripts` in `package.json`: `"start": "node server.js"`.
- Typical platform settings — Build: `npm install && npm run build` · Start: `npm start` · Health check: `/healthz`.

## Deploy (pick one — all configs are already in the repo)

### Option 1 — Netlify (fastest, drag & drop)
1. `npm install && npm run build`
2. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop and drag the **`dist`** folder in. Done.
   *Or* connect the Git repo — `netlify.toml` sets build command `npm run build` and publish dir `dist`.

### Option 2 — Vercel
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel --prod
```
`vercel.json` already sets the Vite framework preset, output dir and headers. Or import the repo at https://vercel.com/new.

### Option 3 — GitHub Pages (automatic)
1. Push this project to a GitHub repo on branch `main`.
2. Repo → **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**.
3. Every push to `main` runs `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and publishes the site.

### Option 4 — Docker / your own server
```bash
docker build -t gocore-web .
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name gocore gocore-web
```
Uses a multi-stage build (Node → nginx) with gzip, caching and security headers (`nginx.conf`).

### Option 5 — Any static host (S3 + CloudFront, Firebase Hosting, cPanel…)
Upload the contents of `dist/` to the web root. That's all.

### Custom domain + HTTPS
Add your domain in the host's dashboard (Netlify/Vercel/GitHub Pages all issue free HTTPS certificates) and point a CNAME/A record as instructed.

## ⚠️ Before taking real bookings or money
This build is a **front-end demo**. Specifically:

| Area | Current behaviour | Needed for production |
|---|---|---|
| Bookings | Saved in the visitor's browser (`localStorage`) | Backend + database (e.g. Supabase / Firebase / Node + Postgres) |
| Login | None — dashboard is open | Customer authentication (email OTP / OAuth) |
| Payments | Simulated, **no real charge** | Payment gateway (Razorpay / Stripe) with server-side order creation + webhook verification |
| Metered kWh | Simulated via buttons | Telemetry feed from the sealed revenue meter on each truck |
| Notifications | None | Email/SMS on booking, dispatch, invoice |
| Legal | Footer disclosure + consent checkbox | Terms, privacy policy, and — for any real nuclear service — national regulator licensing and transport certification |

Never put payment-gateway **secret** keys in this front-end code; they belong on a server.

## Project structure
```
src/
  App.tsx              # shell + hash router
  data.ts              # fleet, rates, depots, estimator maths (edit prices here)
  store.ts             # bookings persistence (localStorage hook)
  components/Layout.tsx
  pages/               # Home, Technology, Fleet, Pricing, Safety, Dashboard
public/
  images/              # hero + prototype images
```

**Change prices / trucks:** edit `TRUCKS` and `CURRENCY` in `src/data.ts`.
